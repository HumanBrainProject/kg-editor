### Edit, suggest, detect conflicts, assure quality, publish, standardize and extend metadata

It is a lot of work to get the metadata right. The KG Editor is a critical component of the metadata management system which makes sure that the ingestion and management of the metadata on the graph database is easy to do and can be 
handled by the domain-specific experts without requiring programming skills. It is used by the EBRAINS curation team as well as data-providers to submit data to EBRAINS.
